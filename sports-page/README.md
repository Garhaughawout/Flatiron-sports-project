Get Up - A Sports Grouping Website


Description:
This project is a grouping site that allows you to join groups posted by other users. These groups are designed to include, time, location,
date, skill level, and how many people are needed. You can create a user by signing-up and get started now at https://flatiron-sports-project.onrender.com/ It also features a fully working JWT accessed login system to allow for users to persist their login through reloads.  

Technologies Used:
In this Project I've used technologies for both the front and backend. For the front-end I used html, css, JavaScript, and React JS. I am currently adding react native to allow for a better mobile experience. For the backend I am using Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy. I also am using a postgreSQL Database on render to allow for data to save. Finally, I am using some pre-styled and optimized components or elements from Material UI. 

Some features currently on the site include Creating, Joining, leaving, and viewing specific groups. Currently I would like to add a way to filter the groups using different options on a menu. Another feature is having a profile page that shows the groups you are currently apart of.
Another feature I plan to implement is an option to join groups that have set times each week or on certain days. I also want to add some backend validations to allow for better user experience especially when signing-up or creating a group.
